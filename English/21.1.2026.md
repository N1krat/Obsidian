_Short answer strategies:_

1. Read the instructions, paying particular attention to the number of words you can use, if you write more than the required number then the answer will be marked wrong 
2. It's important to pay attention to the answer order, short-answer questions will be coming in the same order in the recording as they are listed in the question 
3. Predict the answers, before listening to the recording try to predict the answer to the question this will focus your mind on what to listen out in the recording. When we predict an answer we normally make an educated guess
4. Synonyms and paraphrasing are very used, you will not be only listening to the exact words from the question but also to words and phrases that have the same meaning. Paraphrasing means saying the same thing, the IELTS exam uses different types of paraphrasing: 
	- Synonyms 
	 - Opposites 
	- Different parts of speech 
	 - More general context

5. Problematic vocabulary: 
	 - Time ( telling the time )
	 - Numbers ( be ware of the decimal point )
	 - Prices ( beware of the symbol )
	 - % ( the symbol is after the symbol )
	 - Dates 
	 - Letters 
	 - Addresses ( ex: 47 Schinoasa-Deal Street, Codru )

6. Distractors - the examiners will try to catch you out with the distractors, _a distractor is a word or phrase that changes or corrects the original piece of information given_
	- Examples: 
		- Entrance price was $6.50 per person until may the 1st when it increased by 20 cents to $6.70
		- For most the year: we are open from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm but now that the dark days of December have arrived we welcome visitors from 10:00 am and close at 4 o'clock (16:00)

7. Guess if necessary - never leave a blank space on the answer pallet, if you have not heard the answer properly make a guess
