# Lesson 14

## Topic: Matching Heading 

### Tips and Strategies: 

1. Ability to identify the main idea of a paragraph
2. Understanding of paraphrasing and synonyms and the ability to distinguish the main idea from details 
3. Always read the headings first: 
	- Scheme all heading quickly
	- Underline keywords 
	- Predict categories 
4. Identify the main idea, not details! You must ask yourself: 
	 - What is this paragraph mainly about? 
	 - Why did the writer write this text? 
	 - What is the focus or the conclusion of the paragraph? 
5. Focus on first and last sentences. First sentence introduces the topic, the Last sentence evaluates the topic
6. Expect heavy and difficult paraphrasing: 
	- Scientific Findings / Researchers discovered 
	- Economic Impact / Costs increased dramatically 
7. Eliminate distractors systematically. Usually 2 or 3 headings are extra and some headings look very similar, you are advised to cross-out clearly wrong headings, compare the remaining ones carefully, avoid rushing decisions 
8. Watch paragraph functions: 
	- Introducing a topic
	- Describing a problem 
	- Presenting evidence 
	- Giving examples 
	- Drawing conclusions 
	- Contrasting view points 
9. Time management:
	- Heading headings first - 1 min max 
	- Scheme paragraph - 30 - 45 sec each
	- Match immediately if clear
	- Avoid wasting time, skip difficult ones, return later 
10. Check thoroughly. Before submitting insure each heading fits globally / fully. 
11. Check logical progression and confirm no heading fits better elsewhere
