_Strategies when working with plans:_
1. Read the plan before the audio starts (Crucial!)
	1. Identify what the place is 
	2. Find the starting point 
	3. Look for fixed reference points 
2. Predict the type of answer (noun, compound noun, composite word etc. max 2-3 words, you will never be asked to search for plurals only if they specifically repeat them, and no articles)
3. Direction language 
	1. go past, go along, cross, head towards, turn left, turn right, just beyond, opposite etc...
4. Always follow the speakers root not the paper order
5. The answers are not from the left to right, they have no order 
6. Ignore labels you already see printed them on the map, we don't need to label them again
7. Sing-posting language
8. Distractors ( first mention is often wrong, last information is the answer )
9. Spelling ( be consistent with the spelling )
