# Lesson 13 Reading 

## Topic: Matching-Information Questions

More challenging than sentence completion 

_Tips:_
You must: 
1. Locate specific information in paragraphs 
2. Paraphrasing and recognizing it 
3. Distinguish between similar ideas 
4. Avoid assuming answers 
5. Follow paragraph order 

_**Important!!**_ 
The statements do not follow the order of the text.

### Step-by-step strategy: 

_Step 1:_
	Read the instructions carefully
	Check how many paragraphs are there
	Can a paragraph to be used more than ones 
	Are there any extra options
	
_Step 2:_ 
	Never read the whole text first ( Many students waste 5-7 min reading everything )
	Read the statements first. Once you read the statements, ask yourself "what type of information is this?": 
		1. Example
		2. Reason 
		3. Opinion 
		4. Problem 
		5. Cause 
		6. Description
		7. Historical reference 

_Step 3:_ 
	Identify key-words in each statement. Underline: 
		1. Names 
		2. Dates
		3. Numbers
		4. Unique nouns
		5. Strong adjectives

"A paragraph <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">which</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">why</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 112, 192)">early research</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">failed</span>"

_Step 4:_ 
	Scan for key ideas ( not exact words ). You are not looking for matching vocabulary, you are looking for: 
		1. Same meaning 
		2. Same idea
		3. Same concept 
Ex: 
"Refers to financial difficulties"
alternatives: 
_struggle economically_
_fazed founding shortages_
_lacked financial support_
	IELTS wants you to be good at paraphrasing!

_Step 5:_
	Match the idea not just the word! You must confirm that the entire idea matches not just the one word.

_Step 6:_
	Eliminate clearly wrong paragraphs. Ask yourself "Does this paragraph talk about this idea at all?", "Is it too general?", "Is it about something different?". _Important! Elimination saves time! Time management is crucial in this exam!_ 
	Time management: 20 mins total. Spend 3-4 min scanning statements. 

_**Traps to avoid!**_
	1. To paragraphs may describe the same idea, but only one matches the exact detail
	2. Synonym confusion 
	3.
