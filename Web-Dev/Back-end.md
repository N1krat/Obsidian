`Definition:`
It involves the building of the server-side logic and [database](Database.md) components of a web application. It is responsible for processing user requests, managing data and ensuring the overall functionality of the application.

#### Server / Cloud instance
An essential component of the arhitecture of a web application is a _**server**_ or _**cloud instance**_. A _cloud instance_ is a virtual server instance that can be accessed via _Internet_ and is created, delivered and hosted on a public or private cloud. 

It functions as physical as a physical server that may seamlessly move between devices. It is very dynamic, scalable and economical.

#### [Databases](Database.md)
_**Database management**_ is a crucial part of a web application because using it we store, retrieve and manage data in web applications. There are various database systems that have similar functionalities and roles for organizing and structuring data. 

---
#### [Application programming interface](API.md)
_**Application programming interfaces**_ are sets of rules and protocols that help different software to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. 
- _**RESTful**_ APIs and _GraphQL_ are common approaches for defining and interacting with web services.

#### Server-side languages
These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including _data processing_, database interaction, and the creationg of _dynamic content_ that is delivered to client's browser. 

Some popular server-side languages are: 
1. _**PHP:**_ it is widely used server-side scripting language. It is embedded in HTML code and is particularly well-suited for web development. 
2. _**Python:**_ this is a versatile, high-level programming language used for a variety of purposes, including server-side web development. Frameworks like _**Django**_ and _**Flask**_ make it easy to build web applications in Python. 
3. _**Node.js (JavaScript):**_ JS is traditionally a client-side language but _Node.js_ enables devs to run JS on the server side. It is suitable for making high-performance applications. 
4. _**Go (Golang):**_ [Go](Go.md) is a statically typed language developed by the Google. It is known for its simplicity and efficiency and is increasingly being used for making of scalable and high-perfomance web applications.

#### Full-stack development 
Full-stack dev refers to the practice of desinging, building and maintaining the entire _software stack_ of a web application. Here we include both the [Front-end](Front-end.md) and the [Back-end](Back-end.md) components as well the [database](Database.md) and any other necessary infrastucture. 

A full-stack developer is someone who has experience in working both the fronend and backend tehnologies, allowing them to handle all aspects of Web application development. 

- _**MEAN**_ (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and _**MERN**_ (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) are popular full-stack development stacks.
