This is the process of desinging and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It involves creating a visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact directly.

#### Tehnologies
The 3 core tehnologies for front-end are: 
- _**HTML ( Hypertext Markup Language )**_ - provides the structure and organization of the page 
- _**CSS ( Cascading Style Sheet )**_ - is responsible for the styles and layout. CSS creates the appearence of our page. 
- _**JavaScript**_ - it is used to create interaction of web pages. JS has given rise to many popular front-end frameworks such as [React](React.md), [Angular](Angular.md) and [Vue.js](VueJs.md) etc.

#### User interface design
The UX design focuses on creating interfaces that are easy to understand, intuitive, accesible and good looking for the users. It involves the understanding of user behavior, conducting usability studies and implementing design principles to enhance the overall satisfaction. 

Some of the popular tools used for UI Wireframing are: 
- Figma
- MockFlow
- Sketchs
- etc

#### Responsive design
It is important to ensure that web applications are accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Responsive design uses _CSS media queries_ and flexible layouts to adapt to diferent viewing environments.

### Front-end frameworks
A _framework_ is a high-level solution for the reuse of some pieces of software, this is the next step in the simple library-reuse that shares common functions and generic logic of a domain application. 

Frameworks and libraries are tools that extend the development process. These tools enhance developer productivity and contribute to the easyer maintaince of large-scale applications. Some popular front-end frameworks are: 
- [React](React.md) - a JS library for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta ( Facebook ). It allows developers to create reusable UI components. 
- [Angular](Angular.md) - a _TypeScript_ based front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It provides a solution for building dynamic [single-page applications](Single%20page%20applications.md). 
- [Vue.js](VueJs.md) - a progressive _JavaScript_ framework that is easy to learn yet powerful, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or other projects.

#### State management 
Managing the state of the web application is very imporant because we need to ensure data consitency and responsiveness. State management libraries like [Redux](Redux.md) for _React_ and [Vuex](Vuex.md) for _Vue.js_ play a big role in the complex applications.
