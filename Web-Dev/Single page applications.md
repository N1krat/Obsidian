`Definition:`
A _**single-page application**_ is web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of loading entire new pages. 

--- 
In a _SPA_ a page refresh never occours. Instead HTML, JS, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.
