#### Features
_**Components:**_
Angular uses a component-based arhitecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable user interface elements. Each component combines in it HTML, CSS and TypeScript making it easier to manage. 

_**Routing:**_
Angular includes a router that allows devs to manage application states and navigation paths, making it easier to build SPA's with complex routing. 

For routing in Angular we use the official library `@angular/router`.  

_**Server-side rendering:**_
Angular has official support for server-side rendering which improves application's loading time and performance. Server-side rendering also improves search engine optimization by making the content more accesible to web crawlers. 

_**Zoneless application:**_ 
A zoneless appliction is an _Angular_ app that removes zone.js library enabling more granular and explicit control over change detection by shifting repsonsibility from the library to signals and other mechanisms.
