There are many types of databases: 
- _**Relational databases:**_ there a databases structured in tables to organize and relate the data. Common examples include - MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more. 
- _**NoSQL databases:**_ these are databases that are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can be more flexible than _relation databases_. They come in various types such as _document-oriented, key-values stores_ and _graph databases_. Examples: _MongoDB_. 
- _**Graph databases:**_ these are designed to represent and query data in the form of graphs. They are effective for handling relationships and network-type data. 
- _**Document stores:**_ these databases store data in a _semi-structured_ format, typically using _JSON_ or _XML_ documents. Each document can have a unique structure providing flexibility. Examples: _MongoDB_ or _CouchDB_. 

The choice of a database depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, performance considerations and other factors. Each type of database has its strenghts and weaknesses and selecting the right one depends on the project.
