In contrast to a _user interface_ which connects a computer to a person an API connects computers or pieces of software to each other. 
An API is often made from different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to _**call**_ that porting of the API.
The calls that make up the API are also known as _subrutines_, _methods_, _requests_ or _endpoints_.
